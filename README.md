The objective of this project is to showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap while customizing a Bootstrap template to meet the specific needs of the EWSETA Career Guidance Portal.

## Introduction

The EWSETA Career Guidance Portal is an important platform for providing career guidance and opportunities to individuals seeking employment in the energy and water sectors. The purpose of this capstone project is to rebuild the home page of the existing website, enhancing its design and functionality to create an engaging user experience. The goal is to showcase my expertise in front-end web development and create a visually appealing and intuitive home page for the portal.

## Objective

The main objective of this capstone project is that it provides practical experience in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap by rebuilding the home page of the EWSETA Career Guidance Portal. This project allows me to demonstrate my proficiency in front-end web development techniques, including responsive design, layout customization, and interactive elements.


## Requirements

To meet the requirements of this capstone project, I focused on the following aspects:

### Rebuilding the Home Page
The primary task was to rebuild the home page of the EWSETA Career Guidance Portal. I utilized a full Bootstrap template as the foundation and customized it to align with the specific design requirements of the portal. Attention to detail and consistency were crucial in recreating the home page faithfully.

### Design Customization
To give the EWSETA Career Guidance Portal an enhanced visual appeal, I customized the design of the home page. Leveraging the flexibility of Bootstrap, I made modifications to colors, typography, layout, and other visual elements. The objective was to create a visually striking and professional-looking home page that aligns with the portal's purpose.

### Responsive Design
Creating a responsive design was a key aspect of this project. I ensured that the home page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. By utilizing Bootstrap's responsive grid system and CSS media queries, I achieved optimal display and usability across various devices.

### Interactive Elements
To enhance user engagement, I incorporated interactive elements on the home page. This may include sliders, animated sections, hover effects, or any other interactive components that contribute to a dynamic and captivating user experience.
